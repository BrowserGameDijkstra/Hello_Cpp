/* 1- In header file, You declare all of the class functions and variables. You determine which one is public, protected or private.

2- In source file, You write the function body and use the variables you declared in header.

3- You will learn about Scope operator (::) in the following lessons.
Only note that it is an operator for recalling constructors (and every other functions) of a class in source file.
