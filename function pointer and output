//Regarding the point in the yellow box, keep in mind arguments passed by reference (with a pointer) WILL change if they're modified in the function. For example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printSomething(int * x) {
    *x = *x + 1;
    cout << *x << endl;
}

int main() {
    int x = 42;
    int* px = &x;
    printSomething(px);
    cout << x << endl;
}

//In the example above, both couts will display 43
